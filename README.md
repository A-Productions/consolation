Unity's editor console is indispensible, but retrieving debug logs and warnings
outside the editor is difficult. To make it easier, this console displays
output from the `Debug` class, as well as any errors and exceptions thrown, in
the game itself. This is especially useful on mobile devices.

Attach this script to a game object. The window can be opened with a
configurable hotkey (defaults to backtick).
