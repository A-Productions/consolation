Attach this script to a game object to display a console while playing.
Messages sent to `Debug.Log` and errors thrown are collected and displayed in a
window. This is useful when testing on mobile devices or anywhere else that
you're unable to access Unity's console logs. The window can be opened with a
configurable hotkey (which defaults to the backtick).
